/**
 * Hajj Transfers page — 2026 heading-structure update.
 *
 * Verified facts only: real route distances/durations (data/routes.ts,
 * matching the figures already published on each route's own page), real
 * airports (data/airports.ts), real cities (data/cities.ts), real vehicle
 * categories (data/vehicles.ts). Deliberately NOT a duplicate of the Umrah
 * page: Hajj involves official permits, fixed group scheduling, and access
 * rules that Umrah doesn't, and this page says clearly that those rules
 * come from the authorities, not from us. No specific current restriction
 * is stated as fact — official Hajj rules change and must be checked
 * against the current, authoritative source, not asserted here. The old
 * "Official Hajj Restrictions: What We Won't Tell You, and Why" heading
 * (awkward, negative) is retired per the brief in favour of "Hajj
 * Transportation and Official Requirements" — same honest content, a
 * more professional framing.
 *
 * Scope note: does not compete with the homepage, Airport Transfers,
 * Intercity Transfers, or the Umrah page — this page owns "private
 * transportation for Hajj travel" specifically and links out to those
 * broader hubs and to individual airport/city/route pages.
 *
 * Previously rendered via ServiceV2View (shared with other service
 * pages). Now rendered via the page-specific HajjTransfersHub component
 * instead, mirroring the Airport/Intercity/Umrah restructuring, so this
 * change doesn't touch any other page.

      question: "Can I arrange transportation from Madinah Airport?",

        "Yes. It's a short transfer, around 20 km and 20-25 minutes, direct to hotels near the Prophet's Mosque.",

      question: "Can families and groups book private Hajj transportation?",

        "Yes. Tell us your group size and luggage when booking and we'll coordinate the right combination of vehicles rather than a single car for everyone.",

    {
      question: "Which vehicle should I choose for my Hajj group?",

        "It depends on passengers and luggage more than headcount alone — a sedan for one or two, an SUV for a family, or a van or minibus for a larger group.",

    {
      question: "What information do I need to provide when booking?",
      answer:
        "Your flight details, accommodation, and passenger and luggage count matter most — flight number especially, since it lets us adjust pickup around any delay.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does booking a private transfer guarantee access to restricted Hajj areas?",
      answer:
        "No. Access to areas restricted during the Hajj period is controlled by the relevant Saudi authorities and tied to official permits and registered group arrangements, not to a transportation booking. Confirm current requirements with your Hajj operator or the relevant authority.",
