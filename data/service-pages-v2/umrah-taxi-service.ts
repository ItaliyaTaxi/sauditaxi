/**
 * Umrah Transfers page — 2026 heading-structure update.
 *
 * Verified facts only: real route distances/durations (data/routes.ts,
 * matching the figures already published on each route's own page), real
 * airports (data/airports.ts), real cities (data/cities.ts), real vehicle
 * categories (data/vehicles.ts). No religious rulings, no visa/eligibility
 * claims, no official pilgrimage-authorisation claims — this is a
 * transportation service and says so plainly, matching the tone already
 * established on this page before this update.
 *
 * Scope note: does not compete with the homepage (broad "Private Transfers
 * Across Saudi Arabia"), Airport Transfers ("Private Airport Transfers
 * Across Saudi Arabia"), or Intercity Transfers ("Private City-to-City
 * Transfers Across Saudi Arabia") — this page owns "private transportation
 * for Umrah travellers" specifically and links out to those broader hubs
 * and to individual airport/city/route pages rather than duplicating them.
 *
 * Previously rendered via ServiceV2View (shared with 6 other service
 * pages). Now rendered via the page-specific UmrahTransfersHub component
 * instead, mirroring the Airport Transfers and Intercity Transfers
 * restructuring, so this change doesn't touch any other page.
