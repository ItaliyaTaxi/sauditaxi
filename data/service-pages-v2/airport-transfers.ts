 * Airport Transfers hub page — 2026 heading-structure update.
 *
 * Verified facts only: real airport names/codes (data/airports.ts), real
 * route distances (data/routes.ts), real vehicle categories (data/vehicles.ts),
 * and the site's actual booking model (WhatsApp/quote form, pay the driver
 * directly — no online payment platform, no specific wait-time guarantee,
 * none of which exist in the real system). No Hajj-permit, visa, or
 * government-authorisation claims — see the Umrah/Hajj section note.
 *
 * Previously rendered via ServiceV2View (data/service-pages-v2/airport-transfers.ts
 * + components/services/ServiceV2View.tsx, shared with 7 other service
 * pages). Now rendered via the page-specific AirportTransfersHub component
 * instead, so this restructuring doesn't touch the other 7 pages that still
 * use ServiceV2View unchanged.
