/**
 * Intercity (city-to-city) Transfers hub page — 2026 heading-structure
 * update.
 *
 * Verified facts only: real route distances/durations (data/routes.ts,
 * matching the figures already published on each route's own page), real
 * cities (data/cities.ts), real vehicle categories (data/vehicles.ts), and
 * the site's actual booking model — no online payment, no Hajj-permit or
 * government-authorisation claims.
 *
 * This is deliberately the page restructured for "Private City-to-City
 * Transfers Across Saudi Arabia" rather than /city-transfers: on this site,
 * /city-transfers is a distinct, already-established page for short trips
 * WITHIN one city (hotel to a meeting, home to a station), while this page
 * (/intercity-transfers) is the one that already covered city-to-city
 * routes like Jeddah-Makkah and Riyadh-Jeddah before this update, and still
 * does — restructuring /city-transfers instead would have meant abandoning
 * its own established local-transfer identity and duplicating this page's
 * route content. See the execution log in docs/seo-topic-clusters-plan.md
 * or the relevant commit message for the full reasoning.
 *
 * Previously rendered via ServiceV2View (shared with 7 other service
 * pages). Now rendered via the page-specific IntercityTransfersHub
 * component instead, mirroring the Airport Transfers restructuring, so
 * this change doesn't touch any other page.
