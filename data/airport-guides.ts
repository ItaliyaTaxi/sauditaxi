/**
 * Airport-specific content merged into data/airports.ts, powering the 13
 * individual /airport-transfer/{airport} pages (rendered via
 * components/airport-transfer/AirportTransferHub.tsx). Kept separate so the
 * base airport records in data/airports.ts stay readable.
 *
 * 2026 restructuring: replaced the old generic-travel-guide `sections`
 * (terminal deep-dives, "travel tips", tourist highlights) with a
 * commercially focused set of fields — a core-service paragraph, arrival
 * context, and a per-airport "major destinations" cluster (the one section
 * each page customizes, per the page architecture brief) — plus a trimmed,
 * airport-specific FAQ (6-8 questions). The meet & greet flow, vehicle
 * options, and booking steps are shared/universal across every airport (the
 * same real service, just interpolated with the airport's name and code)
 * and are built once in app/(main)/airport-transfer/[airport]/page.tsx
 * rather than repeated here.
 *
 * Content invents no terminal numbers, parking policies, meet-and-greet
 * procedures, or vehicle models beyond what data/vehicles.ts and
 * data/routes.ts actually support.
