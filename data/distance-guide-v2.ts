      { question: "Is there a train between Riyadh and Dammam?", answer: "Yes — the SAR (Saudi Arabia Railways) East Line has connected the two cities with passenger service since 1985, calling at Hofuf and Abqaiq, with both a regular (~4.5-hour) and an express (~3h40m) service." },

      { question: "What is the fastest way to travel this route?", answer: "The SAR express train, at around 3 hours 40 minutes, is marginally faster than driving, though it only runs once daily in each direction and is station-to-station rather than door-to-door." },

      { question: "Is there a direct flight from Madinah to Jeddah?", answer: "Yes, it's a very frequently served route — around 441 flights per week across four airlines, with a flight time of about one hour." },
      { question: "How much buffer time should I plan if I'm flying internationally from Jeddah?", answer: "This isn't something we can state a fixed number for, since it depends on your airline's specific check-in requirements — but given the roughly one-hour domestic flight or four-to-five-hour drive from Madinah, most travellers build in a meaningful buffer beyond the base travel time before an international departure." },
      { question: "Is there a train between Madinah and Jeddah?", answer: "Yes, the Haramain High-Speed Railway connects Madinah directly to Jeddah, including a station near King Abdulaziz International Airport." },
      { question: "What's the fastest way to reach Jeddah's airport from Madinah?", answer: "A direct flight, at around one hour, is the fastest option; the Haramain train is the fastest ground option and connects near the airport." },
      { question: "Can a private transfer go directly from a Madinah hotel to Jeddah's airport?", answer: "Yes — a single hotel-to-airport trip without a station transfer is one of the main reasons travellers choose a private car for this specific departure leg." },
      { question: "Does driving leave enough margin for an international flight?", answer: "It can, but the four-to-five-hour drive leaves less margin for unexpected delays than the one-hour flight or train — worth weighing against how firm your international check-in deadline is." },
