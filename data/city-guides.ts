      "Riyadh's business travel centres on King Fahd Road, Olaya, and the Diplomatic Quarter, with King Abdullah Financial District (KAFD) now a major pickup and drop-off point for corporate riders. Riyadh Season (winter) and major exhibitions at Riyadh Front pull in heavy short-notice demand, so booking a day or two ahead is worthwhile during peak weeks. Getting around the city by private transfer is generally easier than relying on ride-hailing during large events, since a booked car has your route and pickup point confirmed in advance rather than searching for a match. For business trips, request a car with WhatsApp confirmation the night before so your driver is outside your hotel or office at the exact time you asked for.",
    introParagraphs: [
      "Riyadh is the Kingdom's capital and its largest business centre, so most private-transfer demand here is corporate: airport arrivals heading straight to a meeting, teams moving between offices in KAFD and Olaya, and executives who need a driver waiting between appointments rather than a taxi hailed on the street. The city's sheer size — spreading well beyond the historic core into Olaya, the Diplomatic Quarter, and the newer financial district — makes a pre-booked, fixed-price car more predictable than arranging transport on arrival.",
      "The city is also a hub for longer journeys — travellers routing through Riyadh to reach Jeddah, Makkah, Madinah, the Eastern Province, or AlUla commonly book a private car for the whole leg rather than switching between transport types. Pre-booking matters most during Riyadh Season and major exhibitions at Riyadh Front, when short-notice demand spikes across the city and vehicle availability tightens quickly.",
