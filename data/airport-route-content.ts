      "Your flight is tracked from the moment you book, so the pickup time adjusts automatically if you land early or late. Your driver waits for you after you clear customs, holding a name board so you're easy to spot.",

      "The drive from the airport into the city runs south on the main airport expressway before splitting toward whichever district you're heading to — Olaya and the business core, the Diplomatic Quarter, KAFD, or the residential areas further out. Traffic is the main variable: a quiet mid-morning run can be notably quicker than a weekday evening one, which is one reason we track your flight rather than quoting a single fixed clock time.",
