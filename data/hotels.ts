 * Hotels served by our airport-transfer route system.

 * Each hotel belongs to a city (`citySlug`, matching data/cities.ts) and the
 * transfer routes to/from that city's airport are generated automatically in
 * lib/hotel-transfers.ts — no per-hotel page is ever hand-written. Add a hotel
 * here and its two route pages (airport → hotel and hotel → airport), the city
 * hub listing, breadcrumbs, internal links, sitemap entries, and structured
 * data all appear on the next build.
 *
 * To extend to a new city (Riyadh, Makkah, …) simply add hotels with that
 * city's slug; the same system builds `/riyadh/...` pages with zero new code.
