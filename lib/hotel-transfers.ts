/**
 * Dynamic airport ↔ hotel transfer route system.
 *
 * Given the hotels in data/hotels.ts and the airport that serves each hotel's
 * city (via city.nearestAirportSlug), this module generates two transfer routes
 * per hotel — airport → hotel and hotel → airport — with matching slugs, cross
 * links, distance/duration, and breadcrumbs. Pages, listings, sitemap entries,
 * and structured data all read from here, so adding a hotel (or a whole new
 * city of hotels) needs no new code.

// ── Content variations ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 134+ hotel-transfer pages share the same page template, so without some
// deliberate variation they'd read as near-duplicate content to Google (only
// the hotel name and numbers change). Rather than one shared sentence shape,
// every page is assigned one of 5 content "angles" below — each a distinct
// sentence structure that still foregrounds that hotel's own real data
// (blurb, nearby landmarks, area, distance/duration), so pages sharing an
// angle still read differently from each other, not just from the other 4
// angles.
//
// Selection is deterministic (stable across builds, no client JS) and
// context-aware rather than pure random-by-hash:
//   - Makkah/Madinah hotels always get the Pilgrim angle — it's the only one
//     that's actually correct for a Haram-adjacent hotel.
//   - Hotels genuinely close to their airport (<=12km) get the Airport
//     Convenience angle, since that's the hotel's most relevant real fact.
//   - Remaining 5-star hotels alternate between Luxury/Business and
//     Location-based (by a stable hash of the hotel's own slug), so 20+
//     five-star hotels in one city don't all read identically.
//   - Remaining 3-4 star hotels get the Family & Luggage angle.
