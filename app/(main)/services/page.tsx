// service-discovery hub: it routes visitors to the right one of the 8
// service pages based on journey intent, rather than repeating their
// detailed content (which stays the authority on its own page — see
// data/services.ts / the 8 rebuilt service route files). Distinct in
// structure from /contact and /get-quote, and from every individual
// service page: no big hero image, no single card grid, three differently
// composed clusters instead.
